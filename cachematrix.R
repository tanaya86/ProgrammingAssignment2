#Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
#benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
#Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that
#stores a matrix and caches its inverse.
#This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

#This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by
#makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the
#matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## Same here, changed "mean" to "solve" and "m" to "j"
